# Fish Classification with ANN

I built an Artificial Neural Network model for my entry-level project in Global AI Hub Deep Learning Bootcamp.
The goal was to create a model that can classify different fish species based on their images.

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Requirements
Make sure to install the necessary libraries before running the code:

```pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow```
### Dataset
You can find the dataset here: [A Large Scale Fish Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset)
